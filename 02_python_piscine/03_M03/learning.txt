Set Data type
Set data type is a mutable and unordered collection of unique hashable elements, meaning:
	- you can add or remove elements from an existing Set
	- a set doesn't maintain any particular order of its elements
	- Duplicate elements aren't allowed
	- Each element must have a hash value that stays the same for its entire lifetime

There is different ways to create sets
	- Set literals
		This is done using curly braces {}
		example: {obj_0[, obj_1, ..., obj_n]}
		You can add a tuple inside a set, it wont modify it
		example: 
		rgb_colors = {
			(51, 255, 87),
			(51, 87, 255),
			(241, 196, 15),
		}
		The elements of a set can be objects of different data types.
		Elements must be hashable, that means you can add a tuples but you can't add a list, or dictionaries, bytearray
	- The set() constructor
		The set() constructor is useful for cases when you want to create an empty set, example:
		empty = set()
		You can build a set from a list or a tulpe with the constructor, as well as strings which will generate a set of characters. 
		When using the set constructor, the argument must be iterable. The constructor will create individual elements compared to the set litteals which does not unpack it
	- A set comprehension
		It is a concise way to create a set by evaluating an expression over an iterable.
		The syntax is the folowing:
			{expression for member in iterable [if condition]}
				the comprehension 'expression' provides an element in each iteration
				the current 'member' represents the current item or value in the iterable
				the 'iterable' can be any iterable object including a list, tule, set, generator or similar type
				the 'if condition' is optional that you can use to filter existing collection or generate elements conditionally
			example:
				usernames = [
					...     "Alice",
					...     " bob",
					...     "ALICE  ",
					...     "Bob",
					...     "charlie",
					...     "Charlie",
					...     "JOHN"
					... ]
					
					>>> {name.lower().strip() for name in usernames}
					{'bob', 'alice', 'john', 'charlie'}



Dictionaries
	A python dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pais, where each key corresponds to its associated value.
	Python dictionaries have the following characteristics:
		- Mutable: the dictionary values can be updated in place
		- Dynamic: Dictionaries can grow and shrink as needed
		- Efficient: they're implemented as hash tables, which allows for fast key lookup
		- Ordered: they keep their items in the same order
	There is also the following restrictions:
		- Hashable: you can't use unshashabe objects like lists as dictionary keys
		- Unique: cannot have duplicate keys
	Different ways to create a dictionary:
		- Set Literals
			You can define a dictionary by enclose a comma-separated series of key-value pairs in curly braces {}
			To separate the keys from their values, you need to use a colon :
			example:
				{
				<key_1>: <value_1>,
    			<key_2>: <value_2>,
    			...,
    			<key_N>: <value_N>,
				}
		- The dict() constructor
			same as set
